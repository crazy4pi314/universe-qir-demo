 **Abstract:** Building a new open source community can be challenging, especially when it involves cutting edge technology like quantum computers. The QIR Alliance is developing open source specifications and tooling to help connect the quantum hardware into our traditional computation stack built on top of LLVM. Enriching popular classical developer tools from Python to C++ with access to quantum accelerators, the QIR Alliance enables everyone to contribute to the development of quantum computing, including middleware integrators, hardware providers, domain experts, students, and educators. Join us, and see how the QIR Alliance uses Codespaces to make it easy for all to use and contribute to the open source quantum ecosystem.
